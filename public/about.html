<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, how are you? I hope this message find you in great spirits. I'm not quite sure what to say. Our great teacher
  Angela told us to say a few words about overself and I'm drawing a blank. I guess I'll give you the basics, how about
  that? My name is Suzette but I prefer to go by Suzie. I reside in the US and I'm excited to be apart of Angela's Web Dev
  Bootcamp course on Udemy. I like to naturally surround myself with good people and she seem like a joy to be around. She comes
  across very personable & knowledgable so it makes learning from her very easy, especially if you're already exciated abou 
  the topic. Welp, that's all for now, I'll hopefully update this page as I go further along in the course. This exercite was
  apart of us starting our portfolio. Sounds exciting, huh? lol Remember, don't stress what you can't change! Later!</p>
